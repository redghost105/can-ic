# Dashboard Implementation Plan and Progress

## Implementation Plan

### Overview

The dashboard is the central hub for users after logging in, and needs to be tailored to each role's specific needs (customer, driver, shop, admin). This implementation will create a unified dashboard layout with role-specific content and functionality.

### Goals

1. Create a consistent dashboard layout with shared navigation
2. Implement role-specific dashboard home pages with relevant data and actions
3. Ensure proper access control for dashboard features
4. Create reusable dashboard components for common functionality

## UI Style Reference Guide

To maintain consistent design language across the application, we'll adapt the UI style from the Enatega Food Delivery platform to our MechanicOnDemand context. The following are key UI elements and their adaptations:

### 1. Card-Based Content Layout

- **Food Delivery Style**: Restaurant and food item cards with images, ratings, and quick-action buttons
- **MechanicOnDemand Adaptation**: 
  - Service request cards with vehicle thumbnails
  - Mechanic shop cards with shop logo, rating, and specialization badges
  - Status cards for active services with progress indicators

### 2. Status Tracking Interface

- **Food Delivery Style**: Order progress tracking with timeline showing preparation, pickup, and delivery
- **MechanicOnDemand Adaptation**:
  - Multi-step service timeline showing: requested, accepted, in-transit, at-shop, in-service, ready, and completed
  - Location tracking for vehicle transport
  - Service progress indicators with time estimates

### 3. Dashboard Metrics Visualization 

- **Food Delivery Style**: Earnings charts, order volume metrics, customer satisfaction scores
- **MechanicOnDemand Adaptation**:
  - Service volume metrics for shops
  - Earnings charts for drivers and shops
  - Customer satisfaction and ratings visualization
  - Vehicle service history trends

### 4. Navigation Structure

- **Food Delivery Style**: Bottom navigation on mobile, sidebar on desktop with role-specific options
- **MechanicOnDemand Adaptation**:
  - Maintain bottom navigation pattern for mobile
  - Role-specific navigation items
  - Quick action buttons for primary functions (request service, find jobs, etc.)

### 5. Color System

- **Primary**: #3498db (Blue for primary actions and branding)
- **Secondary**: #2ecc71 (Green for success states, confirmations)
- **Accent**: #f39c12 (Orange for notifications, alerts)
- **Danger**: #e74c3c (Red for errors, cancellations)
- **Background**: #f8f9fa (Light gray for page backgrounds)
- **Card Background**: #ffffff (White for card backgrounds)
- **Text Primary**: #2d3436 (Dark gray for primary text)
- **Text Secondary**: #636e72 (Medium gray for secondary text)

### 6. Component Styling

- **Buttons**: 
  - Primary: Filled blue buttons with white text
  - Secondary: Outlined buttons with primary color text
  - Action buttons: Circle buttons for quick actions
  
- **Cards**:
  - Consistent padding (16px)
  - Light shadow (0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1))
  - Rounded corners (8px)
  
- **Status Indicators**:
  - Color-coded pills/badges for different statuses
  - Progress bars for multi-step processes
  
- **Forms**:
  - Floating labels for input fields
  - Inline validation with error messages
  - Step-by-step forms for complex inputs

### 7. Responsive Patterns

- **Mobile First**: Design for mobile screens primarily
- **Grid Layouts**: 1-column on mobile, 2-columns on tablet, 3+ columns on desktop
- **Component Adaptation**: Cards stack vertically on mobile, arranged in grid on larger screens
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar on mobile, sidebar on desktop
