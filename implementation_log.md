# MechanicOnDemand Implementation Log

## Session Date: [Current Date]

### Overview

This log documents the implementation of the database schema, types, and helper libraries for the MechanicOnDemand application. This work forms the foundation for the application's data layer and authentication system.

### Implemented Files

#### 1. Database Types (`src/types/supabase.ts`)

Fixed type errors in the Supabase database type definitions file. This file defines the TypeScript types that correspond to our database tables and relationships, providing type safety when interacting with the database.

Key fixes:
- Added proper relationship declarations with foreign key names
- Fixed type issues with enum values
- Resolved syntax errors in table definitions
- Added proper JSON type support

#### 2. Authentication Library (`src/lib/auth.ts`)

Implemented a comprehensive authentication library that interfaces with Supabase Auth. This library provides:

- Session management using Supabase authentication
- User role validation
- Protected route utilities
- Helper functions for common auth operations

Functions implemented:
- `getSession()`: Retrieves the current authenticated session
- `requireAuth()`: Ensures a user is logged in or redirects to login
- `requireRole()`: Verifies a user has the required role(s)
- `signOut()`: Handles user sign-out

#### 3. Database Utilities (`src/lib/database.ts`)

Created a database utility library that provides type-safe functions for common database operations. This abstracts away the Supabase client implementation details and provides a clean API for server components.

Functions implemented:
- `fetchById<T>()`: Retrieve a single record by ID
- `fetchMany<T>()`: Fetch multiple records with filtering and pagination
- `insertRecord<T>()`: Create a new record
- `updateRecord<T>()`: Update an existing record
- `deleteRecord()`: Delete a record

#### 4. Supabase Client (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)

Set up the Supabase client with proper type definitions:
- Created strongly-typed client using our schema type definitions
- Added support for both client-side and server-side Supabase clients
- Implemented helper for fetching the current user with profile data

#### 5. Database Schema SQL (`src/db/schema.sql`)

Created a comprehensive SQL schema that defines all the tables needed for the application:
- Users, vehicles, shops, drivers tables for core entities
- Service requests and appointments for managing repair services
- Time slots for scheduling
- Payments and payment intents for financial transactions
- Notifications and notification preferences for the notification system
- Reviews for feedback

Added essential features:
- UUID primary keys with auto-generation
- Foreign key relationships with appropriate constraints
- Enum types for all status and category fields
- Automatic timestamps for created_at and updated_at fields
- Triggers to automatically update the updated_at fields

#### 6. Row Level Security Policies (`src/db/rls_policies.sql`)

Implemented comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data security:
- Role-based access control for all tables
- Custom SQL function to get the current user's role
- Policies for each table that limit access based on ownership and role
- Granular control over which users can view, create, update, or delete records
- Special policies for sensitive operations like payment processing

### Next Steps

1. Create authentication pages:
   - Login page
   - Registration page
   - Password reset functionality
2. Implement role-specific dashboards
3. Build the service request creation process
4. Develop the user interfaces for each role

### Technical Decisions

1. **TypeScript Integration**: We're using TypeScript throughout to ensure type safety when working with database entities.
2. **Role-Based Security**: Implemented a role-based access control system using Supabase's authentication and RLS.
3. **Server Components**: Focused on creating server-side utilities that work well with Next.js 14's App Router architecture.
4. **Database Schema Design**: Designed a normalized schema with appropriate relationships between entities.
5. **Security Focus**: Implemented comprehensive RLS policies to ensure data privacy and access control.

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Type Safety with Supabase**: Created comprehensive type definitions to ensure type safety when working with database entities.
2. **Authentication Flow**: Built a robust authentication system that handles different user roles and redirects appropriately.
3. **Database Abstraction**: Created a database utility library that abstracts away the complexities of working directly with the Supabase client.
4. **Row Level Security**: Designed granular policies to ensure data security while allowing appropriate access for each role.
5. **Schema Design**: Balanced normalization with practical access patterns in the database design.
